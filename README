This is a jQuery plugin to obtain the browser language setting 

Note, the browser language can not (generally) be obtained via navigator.language (which is silly but there you go)

The browser language is available in "Accept-language" HTTP header, but this is not directly accessible via javascript.

The plugin makes an ajax request to an url provided by us which must return a json hash with the content of the Accept-Language header. An example would be

    {
        Accept-Language: "es,en;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6"
    }

The Accept-Language header as defined by http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.10 uses an ISO 639-1 language code. The plugin converts this to an English Language description of the Language (e.g. 'Norwegian'), but also returns the complete value of the header if you need to do further processing.

Example usage:

<script>
    $.browserLanguage(my-checking-url, function( languages , acceptHeader ){
      console.log("You lke these languages " + languages.join(",") + " and the complete value of the 'Accept-Language' header is " + acceptHeader);
    })
</script>
